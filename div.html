            The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or 
            weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE - corresponding to the three types of selectors. The
            value represents the count of selector components in each weight category and is 
            written as ID - CLASS - TYPE. The three columns are created by counting the number
            of selector components for each selector weight category in the selectors that 
            match the element.
